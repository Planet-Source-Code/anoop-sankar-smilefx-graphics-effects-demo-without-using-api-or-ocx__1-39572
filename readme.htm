<h2>SmileFX - Readme</h2>
<h5>.: Introduction</h5>
This code sample demonstrates various graphical effects,
like interleaving, mosaicing, color blending, negative etc.
<p>
As a policy (so that even beginners can understand this), I
have not used any API calls or external OCXs.
<p>
The code is fairly well commented and it explains the logic
I used to create the effects. The process is slow, but thats
not an issue here as SmileFX is best used for understanding the
basic algorithms used for these purposes.
<h5>.: But Why..?</h5>
I saw a 10 line code on PSC that creates a laser effect. It
was done using the simple point, pset and line statements. I was
amazed at the effect he created without API and just decided
to experiment myself. I got some cool effects, then I decided to
share it .. and now you have it!
<h5>.: The Girl on the Photo</h5>
She is Aishwarya Rai. A very popular actress and model in India.
She was also Miss World in 1993. Definitely among my favourite
actresses! I even have a gallery of her pics in my website. <a href="http:\\www.smilehouse.cjb.net\downloads\graphics2.php#wp_ash">Click here.</a>
